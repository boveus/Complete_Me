# Complete_Me

This was a paired project that was meant to implement the [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure.  The goal of this project was to create a Trie data structure containing a dictionary and suggested words based on word fragments.  The intended functionality was meant to mimic the behavior of a suggested word functionality on a text messaging application on a cell phone.  There was additional functionality that included learning suggestions (Sort the result based on the number of times a suggestion was selected), deleting words from the Trie, and adding words to the dictionary.  This project solidified my understanding on the Trie data structure and using recursion to traverse a data structure.

I paired with @blsrofe on this project.
